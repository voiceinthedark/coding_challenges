# Isograms

# An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, 
# consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that 
# determines whether a string that contains only letters is 
# an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. 
# Ignore letter case.

# Write a function that will return the count of distinct

# that occur more than once in the input string. The input 
# string can be assumed to contain only alphabets 
# (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.

# IQ Test

# Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task 
# in this test is to find out which one of the given numbers 
# differs from the others. Bob observed that one number 
# usually differs from the others in evenness. 
# Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that 
# among the given numbers finds one that is different in 
# evenness, and return a position of this number.

def iq_test(t):
    odd = [int(a) for a in t.split(' ') if int(a) % 2]
    even = [int(a) for a in t.split(' ') if not int(a) % 2]
    return t.split(' ').index(str(odd.pop())) + 1 if len(odd) == 1 else t.split(' ').index(str(even.pop())) + 1

# ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real 
# IQ test, which means indexes of the elements start from 1 
# (not 0)
